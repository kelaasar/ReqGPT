"Reqid: SWIM-001a--------Rationale: The SWIM Airspeed algorithm shall output the minimum AGCAS airspeed required to perform a 2g flyup as follows:

Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots) = 
SQRT{[2*Load Factor*Gross Weight]/[Air Density at sea level * 
		Coefficient of Lift Max*Wing Area]} / 1.6891 (ft/s/knots)
where
	Load Factor = 2 gs
	Gross weight of the aircraft
	Air Density at sea level = 0.0023769 slugs/ft^3
	Coefficient of Lift Max = 1.24 (CAT I) and 1.10 (CAT III)
	Wing Area of the F-16 = 300 ft^2
Thus,
IF CAT I, Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots)  = 1.25921 * SQRT(Gross Weight)  + 10.0
IF CAT III, Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots)  = 1.33694 * SQRT(Gross Weight) + 10.0",2023-07-28
