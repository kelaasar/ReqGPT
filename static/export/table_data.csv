SWIM-001a," The SWIM Airspeed algorithm shall output the minimum AGCAS airspeed required to perform a 2g flyup as follows:

Auto GCAS Minimum Vcas (knots) =

where
	Load Factor = 2 gs
	Gross weight of the aircraft
	Air Density at sea level = 0.0023769 slugs/ft^3
	Coefficient of Lift Max = 1.24 (CAT I) and 1.10 (CAT III)
